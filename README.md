# Object-Detection

Using this you can detect objects. Here I used pretrained model of deep learning architecture which is based on TensorFlow. Besides you can use any model of TensorFlow from [HERE](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-API)

## Installation

To run this code, first you need to install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) in your system and also [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) according to your platform.

Besides we need an IDE to run it. I would suggest to use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

After installing everything, open Command Prompt and type conda. If nothing works then go to ProgramData in your "C" drive (Hidden items) then Miniconda3 then condabin and copy the path. Then go to the system in control panel and click advance setting then Environment Variables then double click on path (upper section) then click new and paste the copied path and save it.
Now again type conda on Command Prompt. If it's work then you're ready to go.

Now extract the file and open the VSCode on that folder. 
* Open Terminal of VSCode
* Type conda install jupyter
* Type pip install opencv-python
* Type pip install matplotlib

Enjoy It!!!
